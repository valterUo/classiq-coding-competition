    "Let us assume that we have $n$ variables $x_i$ for $i = 0, \\ldots, n - 1$. To have consistent notation we start indexing from $0$. Now each of these variables has a value $0,1,2,3$. In order to express to problem using the binary variables, we define binary variables $x_{i, j}$ so that $i = 0, \\ldots, n - 1$ and $j \\in \\left\\{0,1,2,3 \\right\\}$. Thus we have $4n$ binary variables in the final model. The interpretation of the binary variables is simple: $x_{i,j} = 1$ if $x_i = j$. This enables us to encode integers into binary model."

    "The first idea how to tackle the challenge is to assign a state for each binary variable $x_{i,j}$. In the end, if we measure $x_{i,j} = 1$, then we know that $x_i = j$. For example, the variable $x_{0,0}$ would correspond to the state $|0000\\rangle$ in the case $n = 4$. Because the number of states grows exponentially, we would be able to represent large problems with small number of qubits. If we are able to tranform the constraint into Grover oracle which favours those states which corresponds to the solution of the problem, this would solve the problem. Anyway, constructing such oracle seems a complicated task.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think this exercise shows an interesting and also confusing point about quantum oracles. Usually quantum oracles encode the problems that we are solving. Oracles are black-box. Because we are constructing something, which we are not supposed to know, we actually solve the problem before we even send it to the quantum computer. In that sense, the quantum computer is just a machine that we use to read the result from the oracle. I will study this property deeper later."

In other words, if we flip the phase of the state corresponding the variable $x_{0,j}$ (meaning it is part of the solution), then we do not flip variable $x_{1,j}$. If we were to flip the both variables, then it would mean $x_0 = j = x_1$ which is not allowed.\n",

At each appending phase, we check if some of the previous constraints are violeted. If a constraint is violeted, we drop the circuit from the process. Finally, we are left with Grover oracles that produce the correct solution to the problem."
